  This is Khoa Le;
  I am majoring in Computer Science;
  I am interested in Career Service Center where I can collect valuable information and advice;
  I like Franklin Atonio Hall. The lecture hall looks nice, the building is modern, and the building has a great view coffee shop;
  My trick for not getting lost on campus is to hold a google map on my hand while walking around the campus;
  If I wake up as an animal, I want to be a combination of a monkey and a leopard. I want to be a part of monkey because its close to human and a part of leopard because of its speed;
  Also, be a part of wild animals gives freedom of exploring the world and myself;
